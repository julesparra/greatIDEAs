        <h2>Common learning disabilities:</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 102%"><b>Dyslexia</b><p>
            <p><b>What it is:</b> a general term for disorders that involve difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbols, but do not affect general intelligence.</p>
            <p><b>Affects:</b> about 5-15% of people</p>
            <p><b>Possible solutions:</b> Look for schools that work individually or in small groups with dyslexic students on their specific needs, such as language skills and reading/writing techniques.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 102%"><b>Dyscalculia</b><p>
            <p><b>What it is:</b> difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic, such as difficulty in understanding and manipulating numbers,and learning facts in mathematics.</p>
            <p><b>Affects:</b> about 3-7% of people</p>
            <p><b>Possible solutions:</b> Many students with dyscalculia struggle with the language based elements of mathematics, so programs should avoid reliance on language and auditory memory. Useful strategies include chunking of information, focus on key elements of the questions, and building strong connections between prior and new knowledge.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 102%"><b>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</b><p>
            <p><b>What it is:</b> characterized by hyperactivity, lack of attention, and impulsivity. People with ADHD may have a hard time focusing, listening, keeping track of belongings, and remembering details.</p>
            <p><b>Affects:</b> about 11%</p>
            <p><b>Possible solutions:</b> Look for a school with a low faculty/student ratio, and with staff that is adequately trained to recognize the needs of your child. Be aware of the discipline policy - students should be redirected rather than harshly penalized.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 102%"><b>Autism</b><p>
            <p><b>What it is:</b> Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by social-interaction difficulties, communication challenges, and a tendency to engage in repetitive behaviors. </p>
            <p><b>Affects:</b> about 1 in 68</p>
            <p><b>Possible solutions:</b> Search for schools that offer specialized, highly-structured curriculums with small classes and well-trained staff. Another key factor would be access to various therapy resources. Speech, occupational, and physical therapists can be excellent aids in your child&rsquo;s development.</p>
