          <h3>What legislation is in place for students with disabilities?</h3>
            <img src="blurb1.png" width="40%" height="40%" style="float: left; padding: 2%">
            <p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 (IDEA) outlines requirements that all schools must meet for special education. The Department of Education ranks states and the District of Columbia on whether they &ldquo;need assistance&rdquo; or meet requirements.
              DC and Maryland currently rank as needing assistance. Virginia meets requirements. Washington DC&rsquo;s public school system ranks lower than any single private school in the district.
              This is partially due to a majority of special education students&rsquo; files were inaccurate and a large number of disproportionately minority students in the special education program.
              No state, including Maryland and DC, is required to compile data on how much they spend on early intervention special education students.</p>

          <h2>Differences Between Public and Private Schools</h2>
          <h3>How does a public school district meet IDEA requirements?</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>A student should attend the same school they would attend if they did not have the disability.</li>
              <li>The education and any additional resources should be of no additional cost to the family.</li>
              <li>The student should be given an individualized education plan (IEP).</li>
              <li>The student should be evaluated prior to being enrolled to the special education program.</li>
              <li>All services needed based on the IEP should be provided.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What is the difference between public and private school requirements?</h3>
          <img src="blurb2.png" width="40%" height="40%" style="float: left; padding: 2%">
          <p>Private schools do not receive funding for special needs students, do not have to follow any of the IDEA qualifications, and <i>might</i> be required to provide physical accommodations (e.g. ramps, elevators). IDEA was changed in 2006, so that a very small amount of federal funds goes to students with disabilities, but it is possible that some of the money provided by the school will not reach every student with special needs. There is very little money given to the schools and the only real requirement is that the student receives and instructional service plan (ISP), which is comparable to an IEP, but less comprehensive. Private LEAs (local education agencies) often emerge to house students when the public school district decides that they cannot accomodate them, essentially segregating these disabled students. Here lies the problem with this system. Private schools have no incentive to take these students, so they are forced to go to public schools. If the public school decides that a student is in a certain range of disability, they will not take them. Then the student must go to a private school for disabled students, and the state has to provide funding for them. Underfunding state special education programs can lead to higher prices on the back end.
